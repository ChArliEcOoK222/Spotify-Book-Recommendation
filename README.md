# Spotify Book Recommendations

### Summary
This is a tool that finds a user's most listened to artists in the last 30 days and then uses the main themes of these plus a description of the user in order to produce a list of recommended books which is copied to clipboard.

### What I learned:
- Accessing historical listening data from Spotify using the spotipy library
- Manipulating data structures to produce a specific output
- Using the chat function for GPT 4.1 in order to produce a specific output
- Engineering the prompt for GPT 4.1
- Manipulating the structure of putputs from GPT 4.1
- Copying to clipboard using the pyperclip library
